# TvShowListCli

Lists popular Tv shows, and provides a summary and genre of the show.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'tv_show_list_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install tv_show_list_cli

## Usage

TODO: To run the program, type ruby bin/run

To see the list of tv shows, you will be prompted by the program to type 'y' to see shows or 'exit' to leave the program. Then you will be prompted to enter the name of the show you wish to learn about. After that, you will again be prompted to see the list again or exit the program!

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
